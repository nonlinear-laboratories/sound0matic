The **Sound-0-Matic** is a spectral performance instrument and sampler plugin built using the JUCE/C++ framework.

 Born out of experimental wants and inspired by tools like Paulstretch, Spear, and spectral vocoders (like EB-Dione), its primary goal is to let users load a sound sample and sculpt its spectral-temporal texture using modular effects. It allows musicians and sound designers to manipulate audio using a high-resolution sinusoidal/transient/noise decomposition with custom FFT/phase-domain effects.

 It is inspired by advanced analysis-resynthesis workflows typically found in academic or niche software, repackaged into an open-source, performance-oriented LV2/VST3 plugin and Standalone application.
